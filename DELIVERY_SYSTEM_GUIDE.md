2. **System Loads Animals** - The system automatically fetches all animals in that order
3. **Choose Animal** - Select which specific animal you're delivering from the dropdown
4. **Animal ID is Set** - The system automatically sets the animal ID for you

### 🔄 **How It Works:**

```
Order Selection → Load Order Details → Populate Animal Dropdown → Select Animal → Animal ID is Set
```

### 📱 **User Interface:**

1. **Order Dropdown** shows: `Order #123 - John Doe - ₱5,000.00`
2. **Animal Dropdown** shows: `Fluffy Cat - ₱3,000.00`, `Cute Dog - ₱2,000.00`
3. **You select** the specific animal you're delivering
4. **System automatically** sets the animal ID behind the scenes
